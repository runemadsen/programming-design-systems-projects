# About this repository

This is an empty repository that students in my [Programming Design Systems](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/) class can use as a starter template for their own projects.

## Getting started

- Fork this repo to your own GitHub account
- Open terminal on your computer
- `cd` into the folder where you want the main project folder to exist. For me, this is the `Projects` folder, so I run `cd ~/Projects` from my terminal.
- Clone your new forked repo into this folder by running something like `git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/programming-design-systems-projects.git`. You need to find the actual Git URL on your forked project page.

## Running the projects

You need a web server to see the examples in your browser. Luckily, this repo has a script to do this. Run the following from inside your project folder.

```bash
bash server.sh
```

Now, go to [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) and navigate to any project folder.

## Adding your own projects

Simply make a copy of the `first-assignment` folder and rename it. Now start coding!
